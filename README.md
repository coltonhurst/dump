### Bare Bones Weather

An extremely simple website that gets the weather by zip code.

To run, just open [index.html](bare-bones-weather/index.html) in a web browser with [weather.js](bare-bones-weather/weather.js) in the same directory. Be sure that you put in your own api key in [weather.js](bare-bones-weather/weather.js)!

### Canvas Game Template

A very simple starting template for making a HTML5/JS canvas game.

### C Examples

Just some fun examples of stuff in C. Comments have been added so if the reader doesn't know C, they might get what's actually going on.

### C++

Examples and some work through a C++ book. The cpp-primer was a previous repo.

### Simple Skeleton Example Post

This is a simple blog post made using [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton). I've thought about making my own static site generator, and was curious about an extremely simple, responsive blog post, and so I tried it out using Skeleton.

To run, just make sure the [index.html](simple-skeleton-example-post/index.html) file as well as the [css](simple-skeleton-example-post/css) and [images](simple-skeleton-example-post/images) folder are in the same directory. Then, open [index.html](simple-skeleton-example-post/index.html) in a web browser (as simple as it could possibly be)!

### Vue and Vuetify Hello World

Like the two projects above, it's as simple as possible to run. Just open the [index.html](vue-and-vuetify-hello-world/index.html) in a web browser with [app.js](vue-and-vuetify-hello-world/app.js) in the same directory. It simply displays Hello World, but has Vue and Vuetify integrated as a simple starting point for learning, testing, and building things with the Vue.js framework.
