# cpp-primer

Contains some code from the C++ Primer 5th Edition.

### Chapters
- [Chapter 1](ch1/ch1.md)

### Notes

Most code has been compiled on OS X with g++.

If you're here for actual help and answers from the book, you can find a fairly complete version [here](https://github.com/Mooophy/Cpp-Primer).

Just going through this as a refresher and a learning tool. I don't plan on completing the entire book.
